# Intelligent Alert System for Forest Tribal People

## Overview

This README provides an overview of the internship project titled **"Intelligent Alert System for Forest Tribal People"**. The project was undertaken by **Rahul Teja** (Roll No: 18311A12J8) as part of the requirements for the **Bachelor of Technology** degree in **Information Technology** at **Sreenidhi Institute of Science and Technology**, affiliated with **Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University, Hyderabad**. The project was completed under the guidance of **Dr. K Sreerama Murthy**, Associate Professor, Department of IT, Sreenidhi Institute of Science and Technology.

## Project Summary

The project focuses on developing an **Intelligent Alert System** aimed at enhancing the safety and security of tribal people living in proximity to forests. The system utilizes **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** to monitor forest areas and detect the presence of dangerous animals near tribal villages. Upon detecting a threat, the system triggers an alert to warn the villagers, potentially saving lives and resources.

## Abstract

The tribal population of India has historically been closely linked to forest areas. The proposed system aims to protect these communities by detecting dangerous predators that may enter their vicinity. The system utilizes a camera network to monitor villages at regular intervals, employing CNN for threat detection. Once a threat is identified, the system sends alerts and triggers alarms to warn the villagers, thereby preventing potential losses.
